Hi, I am Neeldeep. Thanks for taking interest in reading the about section. This is where you are supposed to write something good about yourself and ensure people are not wasting their time by click the "About" link.

Well I am software developer working for an IT company. I live in the city of Joy - Kolkata or should I say it lives in me. I am bengali and as the famous saying goes, "You can take a bengali out of Kolkata but you can't take Kolkata out of a Bengali".

I am tech enthusiast, listen to alternative rock, code, hack, love to play games and eat.
